More recently even ditched a <strong>popular data harvesting email provider</strong>. One of my tech mottos has always been <strong>to keep my privacy without sacrifice usability</strong>.</p><p>With that in mind, after <a href="https://lsvra.com/posts/pihole-vodafone-router/">my recent Pi-hole installation</a> I went on and started looking for something to use as a DNS resolver instead of Cloudflare.</p><p>And I came across with Unbound.</p><h2>What is Unbound?</h2><p>From their <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern features based on open standards.</p></blockquote><p>Recursive domain name servers, transverse a given domain consulting the authoritative servers for each query. In short, the DNS resolver will recursively ask the servers responsible for each part of the way until it finds the path for a specific domain.</p><p>On top of this, Unbound, supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DoT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://www.isc.org/blogs/qname-minimization-and-privacy/">Query Name Minimization</a>.</p><p>The code is also <a href="https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound">open source</a>, and it's nice to know that <a href="https://ostif.org/our-audit-of-unbound-dns-by-x41-d-sec-full-results/">was already been audited</a> at least once, in December 2019.</p><h2>What happens when you start using Unbound?</h2><p>Instead of forwarding the requests to the external upstream DNS servers, your Pi-hole will delegate the request to your own recursive DNS resolver.</p><p>For example:</p><ol><li>The recursive DNS resolver asks the DNS root servers: <strong>"Who is handling <a href="">.com</a>?‚Äù</strong></li><li>It receives the response of which TLD servers to ask next.</li><li>The recursive DNS resolver asks one of the TLD DNS servers: <strong>"Who is handling <a href="https://lsvra.com">lsvra.com</a>?"</strong></li><li>It receives the response with the authoritative name servers for <strong><a href="https://lsvra.com">lsvra.com</a></strong>.</li><li>The recursive DNS resolver asks the authoritative name servers for the IP address of <strong><a href="https://lsvra.com"> lsvra.com</a></strong>.</li><li>Finally, it receives the IP address, caches it and passes it to you.<ul></ul></li></ol><p>Since you are doing your own DNS recursive search instead of relying on a 3rd party service, you are the only to know the full path of the websites you visit. <strong>+1 for privacy! ü•á</strong></p><p>This recursive search can also be slower the first time you visit a given website, even though I cannot tell the difference in my daily use. Despite that, after a bit of use, the results start coming instantly from the <strong>local cache</strong>.</p><h2>How do I do set it up?</h2><p>It‚Äôs very easy to setup Unbound alongside your current Pi-hole installation.</p><p>After a little bit of research, I‚Äôve found that the Pi-hole documentation already does a very good job explaining how to set up Unbound. Their suggestions for the configuration file contain all the main tweaks you‚Äôll need. üëç</p><p>So, start by installing unbound with:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">sudo apt install unbound
</code></pre><p>Then download the <strong>root hints file</strong>. This will be the the list of primary root servers which are serving the root domain.<br><br>You can update it <strong>once every six months</strong> or so. The file doesn't change very often.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">wget -O root.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root

sudo mv root.hints /var/lib/unbound/
</code></pre><p>Next, configure your Unbound installation.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">sudo nano/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf
</code></pre><p>We'll use the recommended Pi-hole settings file, but you can still change it's values if needed (eg. turn on <strong>do-ip6</strong> if you have <strong>IPv6 connectivity</strong>).</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">server:

</code></pre><p>Save it by pressing <strong>Ctrl + X</strong> and accepting the changes.</p><p>Great! It‚Äôs almost done!</p><p>Now, start the service and check if your recursive server is operational:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">sudo service unbound start

dig pi-hole.net @127.0.0.1 -p 5335
</code></pre><p>Then enter the following commands to test the <strong>DNSSEC</strong> validation.</p><p>This one should give you a <strong>SERVFAIL</strong> report (without an IP address).</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">dig sigfail.verteiltesysteme.net @127.0.0.1 -p 5335

</code></pre><p>Finally, disable the current DNS server in your Pi-hole and enable the recursive one.</p><p>You can do this by filling the custom dns field with the value <strong>127.0.0.1#5335</strong> (as seen in the image):</p><img src="/images/posts/pihole-unbound-setup/pihole-unbound-setup-1.png" alt="Pi-hole settings page"/><h2>Last but not least.</h2><p><strong>DO NOT</strong> leave your installation exposed to the internet as it might be used in an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/">DNS amplification attack</a>.</p><p>Below you can find a list of services you can use to check if everything is working as expected:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://internet.nl/connection/f4642d70e7ac41a0ac4db98c7abc165a/results#control-panel-5">Internet.nl</a></strong>: IPV6 &amp; DNSSEC Validation</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.rootcanary.org/test.html">Root Canary</a></strong>: DNSSEC Validation</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://canyouseeme.org">Can You See Me?</a></strong>: Open Ports Validation</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.shodan.io/search?query=A+black+hole+for+Internet+advertisements">Shodan</a></strong>: Open Resolver Validation</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://openresolver.com">Open Resolver</a></strong>: Open Resolver Validation</li></ul><p>Bye! üëã</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/pihole">pihole</a></li><li><a href="/tags/unbound">unbound</a></li><li><a href="/tags/privacy">privacy</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Want to reach out? <a href="https://twitter.com/lsvra_">Send me a DM.</a></p><p><a class="the-end" href="https://youtu.be/90Fpjwctqlw">ü§ñ</a></p></footer></body></html>
